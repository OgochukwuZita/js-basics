Statically typed languages are programming languages which require the user to define the data type before initialization of a variable. Here, once the data type is declared the value cannot be changed e.g a string variable will only accept string values while dynamically typed languages do not compulsorily require the data type to be declared. Here, the type of a variable is not asspciated at compile time but is decided at execution time
Statically typed languages inclyde; C, C++, Java, Go
Dynamically typed languages include; Java script, Python, PHP, Rugby

An undefined data type is a variable without a known value, it is assigned the value "undefined" by default while the null data type means something that does not exist. A null value is not assigned by defualt.
